1. Make sure that you're running a FreeBSD src tree which has support
for boot profiling.  (FreeBSD 12-STABLE or later for kernel support;
FreeBSD 13.1-STABLE or later for full loader+kernel+rc.d tracing.)

2. Add 'options TSLOG' to your kernel configuration and `make kernel`.

3. After rebooting, to produce an SVG:
# sh mkflame.sh tslog.svg

4. (Optional) To get a list of the top 10 stack leaves:
# sh tslog.sh > ts.log
# ./stackcollapse-tslog.pl < ts.log | sh supercollapse.sh | head
